Java : Imperative Programming + Object Oriented Programming

```
Quote : Michael Feathers, In OOP we encapsulate moving parts, where as in FP we eliminate moving parts

```
Imperative = Tell me what and also tell me how

Declarative = Tell me what and *not* how
```
So functional programming = Declarative + higher order functions
```
Now in Java 8 : Imperative Programming+ Functional Programming + Object Oriented Programming
