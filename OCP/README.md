# Practical task repository for Complex Task

## General Task Guidelines

*	Please fork the repository to your EPAM GitLab account and make corrections per the principles/topics discussed so far in this course . 
*	The task repository may contain one or more than one practical task per given topic, you are expected to complete all the tasks.
*	Tasks are Java based and it is NOT mandatory to use the latest language versions while making code updates.
*	It is recommended that you complete the practical tasks for a topic before proceeding to the next topics.
*	A task/subtopic will be considered as complete after all the review comments are incorporated from the below mentioned review process.
*	While making changes, any files contained inside package named as 'thirdpartyjars' should be ignored. These file are meant to provide context to the task and are not part of the task.
*	Some tasks have unit tests implemented, if they exist, they are comprehensive and we are free to change production code in any way until tests are green. You may add more tests if you feel appropriate but this is not expected.
*   The goal is not to implement new features, but to refactor of existing code, according to principles you have just learnt. It is mean that all unit tests are green in the beginning and they should remain green after you finish.



## Task Specific guidelines

* task 1: In the near future, you need to add a lot of other Record types, e.g. EducationRecord, VacationRecord, ReportedTimeRecord etc.
What should you change right now in order to make such extensions easier?
* task 2: see README file in the task folder.
